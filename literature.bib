Often, the influences of individual configuration options on performance are unknown. Worse, configuration options may interact, giving rise to a configuration space of possibly exponential size. Addressing this challenge, we propose an approach that derives a performance-influence model for a given configurable system, describing all relevant influences of configuration options and their interactions. Our approach combines machine-learning and sampling heuristics in a novel way. It improves over standard techniques in that it (1) represents influences of options and their interactions explicitly (which eases debugging), (2) smoothly integrates binary and numeric configuration options for the first time, (3) incorporates domain knowledge, if available (which eases learning and increases accuracy), (4) considers complex constraints among options, and (5) systematically reduces the solution space to a tractable size. A series of experiments demonstrates the feasibility of our approach in terms of the accuracy of the models learned as well as the accuracy of the performance predictions one can make with them.},

Knowing in advance which feature selection yields the best performance is difficult because a direct measurement of all possible feature combinations is infeasible. Our work aims at predicting program performance based on selected features. However, when features interact, accurate predictions are challenging. An interaction occurs when a particular feature combination has an unexpected influence on performance. We present a method that automatically detects performance-relevant feature interactions to improve prediction accuracy. To this end, we propose three heuristics to reduce the number of measurements required to detect interactions. Our evaluation consists of six real-world case studies from varying domains (e.g., databases, encoding libraries, and web servers) using different configuration techniques (e.g., configuration files and preprocessor flags). Results show an average prediction accuracy of 95 \%.},

	abstract = {A key challenge of the development and maintenance of configurable systems is to predict the performance of individual system variants based on the features selected. It is usually infeasible to measure the performance of all possible variants, due to feature combinatorics. Previous approaches predict performance based on small samples of measured variants, but it is still open how to dynamically determine an ideal sample that balances prediction accuracy and measurement effort. In this paper, we adapt two widely-used sampling strategies for performance prediction to the domain of configurable systems and evaluate them in terms of sampling cost, which considers prediction accuracy and measurement effort simultaneously. To generate an initial sample, we introduce a new heuristic based on feature frequencies and compare it to a traditional method based on t-way feature coverage. We conduct experiments on six realworld systems and provide guidelines for stakeholders to predict performance by sampling.},

Understanding the correlation between feature selections and performance is important for stakeholders to be able to derive a program variant that meets their requirements. A major challenge in practice is to accurately predict performance based on a small sample of measured variants, especially when features interact. We propose a variability-aware approach to performance prediction via statistical learning. The approach works progressively with random samples, without additional effort to detect feature interactions. Empirical results on six real-world case studies demonstrate an average of 94 \% prediction accuracy based on small random samples. Furthermore, we investigate why the approach works by a comparative analysis of performance distributions. Finally, we compare our approach to an existing technique and guide users to choose one or the other in practice.},

	abstract = {Researchers and software developers require effective performance evaluation. Researchers must evaluate optimizations or measure overhead. Software developers use automatic performance regression tests to discover when changes improve or degrade performance. The standard methodology is to compare execution times before and after applying changes.Unfortunately, modern architectural features make this approach unsound. Statistically sound evaluation requires multiple samples to test whether one can or cannot (with high confidence) reject the null hypothesis that results are the same before and after. However, caches and branch predictors make performance dependent on machine-specific parameters and the exact layout of code, stack frames, and heap objects. A single binary constitutes just one sample from the space of program layouts, regardless of the number of runs. Since compiler optimizations and code changes also alter layout, it is currently impossible to distinguish the impact of an optimization from that of its layout effects.This paper presents Stabilizer, a system that enables the use of the powerful statistical techniques required for sound performance evaluation on modern architectures. Stabilizer forces executions to sample the space of memory configurations by repeatedly re-randomizing layouts of code, stack, and heap objects at runtime. Stabilizer thus makes it possible to control for layout effects. Re-randomization also ensures that layout effects follow a Gaussian distribution, enabling the use of statistical tests like ANOVA. We demonstrate Stabilizer's efficiency (&lt;7% median overhead) and its effectiveness by evaluating the impact of LLVM's optimizations on the SPEC CPU2006 benchmark suite. We find that, while -O2 has a significant impact relative to -O1, the performance impact of -O3 over -O2 optimizations is indistinguishable from random noise.},
