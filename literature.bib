The sheer size of the configuration space makes the quality of software even harder to achieve. Performance is one of the key aspects of non-functional qualities, where performance bugs can cause significant performance degradation and lead to poor user experience. However, performance bugs are difficult to expose, primarily because detecting them requires specific inputs, as well as a specific execution environment (e.g., configurations). While researchers have developed techniques to analyze, quantify, detect, and fix performance bugs, we conjecture that many of these techniques may not be effective in highly-configurable systems. In this paper, we study the challenges that configurability creates for handling performance bugs. We study 113 real-world performance bugs, randomly sampled from three highly-configurable open-source projects: Apache, MySQL and Firefox. The findings of this study provide a set of lessons learned and guidance to aid practitioners and researchers to better handle performance bugs in highly-configurable software systems.},

Often, the influences of individual configuration options on performance are unknown. Worse, configuration options may interact, giving rise to a configuration space of possibly exponential size. Addressing this challenge, we propose an approach that derives a performance-influence model for a given configurable system, describing all relevant influences of configuration options and their interactions. Our approach combines machine-learning and sampling heuristics in a novel way. It improves over standard techniques in that it (1) represents influences of options and their interactions explicitly (which eases debugging), (2) smoothly integrates binary and numeric configuration options for the first time, (3) incorporates domain knowledge, if available (which eases learning and increases accuracy), (4) considers complex constraints among options, and (5) systematically reduces the solution space to a tractable size. A series of experiments demonstrates the feasibility of our approach in terms of the accuracy of the models learned as well as the accuracy of the performance predictions one can make with them.},

Knowing in advance which feature selection yields the best performance is difficult because a direct measurement of all possible feature combinations is infeasible. Our work aims at predicting program performance based on selected features. However, when features interact, accurate predictions are challenging. An interaction occurs when a particular feature combination has an unexpected influence on performance. We present a method that automatically detects performance-relevant feature interactions to improve prediction accuracy. To this end, we propose three heuristics to reduce the number of measurements required to detect interactions. Our evaluation consists of six real-world case studies from varying domains (e.g., databases, encoding libraries, and web servers) using different configuration techniques (e.g., configuration files and preprocessor flags). Results show an average prediction accuracy of 95 \%.},

It is usually infeasible to measure the performance of all possible variants, due to feature combinatorics. Previous approaches predict performance based on small samples of measured variants, but it is still open how to dynamically determine an ideal sample that balances prediction accuracy and measurement effort. In this paper, we adapt two widely-used sampling strategies for performance prediction to the domain of configurable systems and evaluate them in terms of sampling cost, which considers prediction accuracy and measurement effort simultaneously. To generate an initial sample, we introduce a new heuristic based on feature frequencies and compare it to a traditional method based on t-way feature coverage. We conduct experiments on six realworld systems and provide guidelines for stakeholders to predict performance by sampling.},

Understanding the correlation between feature selections and performance is important for stakeholders to be able to derive a program variant that meets their requirements. A major challenge in practice is to accurately predict performance based on a small sample of measured variants, especially when features interact. We propose a variability-aware approach to performance prediction via statistical learning. The approach works progressively with random samples, without additional effort to detect feature interactions. Empirical results on six real-world case studies demonstrate an average of 94 \% prediction accuracy based on small random samples. Furthermore, we investigate why the approach works by a comparative analysis of performance distributions. Finally, we compare our approach to an existing technique and guide users to choose one or the other in practice.},

	abstract = {The disseration concerns universal lossless data compression algorithms such as LZ, PPM, and BWCA methods. A new algorithm based on the Burrows–Wheeler transform is proposed. Its most important features are improved Itoh–Tanaka method for computing BWT, Weighted Frequency Count transform (instead of the MTF), and weighted probability estimation. The performance of the algorithm is evaluated on the Calgary and Silesia corpora.},
