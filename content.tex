\begin{comment}
Most software systems can be customized via configuration options to meet user demands. The selection of configuration options can enable desired functionality (features) or tweak non-functional aspects of a software system, such as improving performance or energy consumption. 
The relationship of configuration choices and their influence on performance has been extensively studied in literature.
The backbone of performance estimation is a model that maps a given configuration to the estimated performance value. 
Learning performance models usually relies on a training set of configuration-specific performance measurements. 
To measure performance, established approaches~\cite{dorn2020,siegmundPerformanceinfluenceModelsHighly2015,haDeepPerf2019,perfAL,guoVariabilityawarePerformancePrediction2013,sarkarCostEfficientSamplingPerformance,guo_2018_data,fourier_learning_2015,perLasso} usually employ only a single workload (e.g., a benchmark or test suite), which aims at emulating a specific real-world application scenario.

Conversely, for performance and load testing in practice, workloads are a widely considered as a key factor for performance variation~\cite{ceesay2020,papadopoulos2021}.
In the domain of cloud computing applications~\cite{papadopoulos2021} and data-intense applications~\cite{ceesay2020}, methodological principles emphasize the importance of using representative workloads or testing against a set of workloads that reflect the system under test and account for workload-specific behavior. Methods for finding such representative workloads are known under the umbrella term \emph{workload characterization}~\cite{calzarossa2016} and are widely used alongside mixes of different workloads in practice~\cite{jiang2015survey}. 

Both configuration-dependent and workload-dependent performance behavior have been studied mostly in isolation. While there are some attempts to gain insights on their combination for specific application scenarios~\cite{alves_sampling_2020}, under limited variability~\cite{liao_2020_using_emse}{\color{purple}, and for a specific problem domain~\cite{koc_satune_2021}}, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to systematically explore the intersection of both factors of variation {\color{purple} across multiple domains}. We aim at providing a clear picture of how prevalent and severe workload-specific differences in configuration-dependent performance are and how they emerge in the wild. 
To illustrate, how both factors may interact, consider the introductory example of an imaginary database system in Figure~\ref{fig:intro}. The method in this example handles an array of insertions. The workload determines how configuration-dependent code is utilized, such as the execution of \colorbox{duplicatecheck}{Lines 2--6} for configuration option \texttt{DUPLICATE\_CHECK}. A performance model that considers this dependency as an input factor might be more representative than a performance model that was trained on a single workload. If a workload, however, conditions the execution of configuration-specific source code, such as \colorbox{autocommit}{Lines 12--14} for configuration option \texttt{AUTOCOMMIT}, one can derive a more representative performance modes from selecting workloads that increase overall code coverage, similar to test coverage.

%In absence of a systematic study that sheds light on whether and how configuration options and workload choices interact with regard to performance, we address this isssue in this paper. 
We have conducted an empirical study of 29\,014 configurations and 55 workloads across 6 configurable software systems to provide a broad picture of the interaction of configuration and workload when learning performance models and estimating a configuration's performance (i.e., response time). Aside from studying the sole effects of workload variation on performance behavior and performance model influences, we explore \emph{how} both factors interact. To this end, we enrich performance observations with corresponding statement coverage data to understand workload variation at a finer grain. This way, we reveal whether workload-specific effects can be attributed to specific code segments or rather depend on workload-specific code usage.

Our findings suggest that the workload-specific
execution of covered option-specific code segments plays a substantial role in how workloads interact with configurations and is most likely accountable for workload-specific performance variation. We conclude that identifying performance-relevant workload characteristics and incorporating them as independent variables is
a promising avenue towards obtaining generalizable and representative performance models.

\section{Background and Problem Statement}
\subsection{Performance Prediction Models}~\label{sec:perfmodels}
Configurable software systems are an umbrella term for any kind of software system that exhibits configuration options to customize functionality. While the primary purpose of configuration options is to select and tune functionality, each configuration choice may also have implications on non-functional properties---be it intentional or unintentional. 
There are different approaches to capture the relationship between configuration options and performance indicators, most basically either analytical or empirical in nature. All share the objective to approximate non-functional properties, such as execution time or memory usage, as a function of software configurations  $c \in C$, formally $\Pi: C \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$. 

Analytic models incorporate existing knowledge about the operations of a software system, comparable to estimating an algorithmâ€™s complexity~\cite{analytic_model_2000,analytic_model_2011}. Here, one deliberately includes or excludes configuration options as predictors and selects a model structure following the current understanding of the software system. While it avoids ambiguity in terms of feature selection and explainability, analytic approaches do not guarantee to cover unanticipated idiosyncrasies or interactions between configuration options.

Empirical performance models, by contrast, do not rely on an understanding of the software system, but on a set of configuration-specific observations. In this vein, finding configurations with optimal performance~\cite{nairUsingBadLearners2017,nairFlash18,ohFindingNearoptimalConfigurations2017} and estimating the performance for arbitrary configurations of the configuration space is an established line of research~\cite{siegmundPerformanceinfluenceModelsHighly2015,haDeepPerf2019,perfAL,guoVariabilityawarePerformancePrediction2013,sarkarCostEfficientSamplingPerformance,guo_2018_data,fourier_learning_2015,perLasso}.
Empirical performance models can be obtained using a variety of machine-learning techniques, including probabilistic programming~\cite{dorn2020}, multiple linear regression~\cite{siegmundPerformanceinfluenceModelsHighly2015}, classification and regression trees~\cite{sarkarCostEfficientSamplingPerformance,guo_2018_data}, Fourier learning~\cite{fourier_learning_2015,perLasso}, and deep neural networks~\cite{haDeepPerf2019,perfAL}.
The set of configurations for training can be sampled from the configuration space using a variety of different sampling techniques~\cite{kaltenecker_interplay_2020}. All sampling strategies aim at yielding a representative sample, either by covering the main effects of configuration options and interactions among them~\cite{siegmundPredictingPerformanceAutomated2012}, or sampling uniformly from the configuration space~\cite{ohFindingNearoptimalConfigurations2017,kaltenecker_distance-based_2019}.
Most approaches share the perspective of treating a configurable software system as a black-box model at application-level granularity. Recent work has incorporated feature location techniques to guide sampling effort towards relevant configuration options~\cite{velez_2020_configcrusher_jase,velez_comprex_2021} or model non-functional properties at finer granularity~\cite{weber_white_2021}.

\subsection{Varying Workloads}
%\subsubsection{Whats is a workload?}
When assessing the performance of a software system, we ask how well a certain \textit{operation} is executed, or, phrased differently, how well an \textit{input fed to the software system} is processed. Such sequences of inputs, commonly called workloads, are essential to assessing performance, even detached from the specific context of configurable software systems. By nature, the workload of a software system is application-specific, such as a series of queries and transactions fed to a database system, a set of raw image files for video encoding, or an arbitrary file for data compression etc. Workloads can often be distinguished by characteristics (dimensions) they exhibit, such as their file size in general, or, the  type of data to be compressed (text, binary data) for instance.

%\subsubsection{Workload Characterization}\label{sec:workload-characterization}
A useful workload for assessing performance or benchmarking should, in practice, closely represent the real-world scenario that the system under test is deployed in. To achieve this, a well-defined and widely employed technique in performance engineering is workload characterization~\cite{ceesay2020,papadopoulos2021}. To select a representative workload, it is imperative to explore workload characteristics and validate a workload with real-world observations. This can be achieved by constructing workloads, among others, from usage patterns~\cite{calzarossa2016}, or by increasing the workload coverage by using a mix of different workloads rather than a single one~\cite{jiang2015survey}.

While workload characterization and benchmark construction is domain-specific, there are numerous examples of this task being driven by community efforts instead of individuals. For instance, the non-profit organizations Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC) and Transaction Processing Performance Council (TPC) provide large bodies of benchmarks for data-centric applications or across different domains, respectively.

\subsection{Representative Estimations?}\label{sec:generalizability}
While the notion of representative workloads is ubiquitous in an industry setting, we face a different situation in research on empirical performance models (cf. Section~\ref{sec:perfmodels}): Most approaches provide accurate performance estimations, yet are based on observations gained by varying configurations while keeping the workload the same. Clearly, this can limit the model's generalizability to different workloads, especially if the training workload poorly represents real-world scenarios. While the configuration-specific behavior might be congruent across different workloads (i.e, a configuration scoring comparably for different workloads), we cannot rely on such assumptions in practice, where different workloads can indeed result in entirely different configuration-specific performance behavior.

Revisiting an observation by \citeauthor{alves_sampling_2020}~\cite{alves_sampling_2020}, the following example illustrates that even seemingly small differences in the composition of a workload can induce performance behavior that is hard to anticipate: We tested the performance (throughput: transactions per second) of a number of configurations for the database system \htwo across two different workloads. Both workloads are instances of the database benchmark \textsf{TPC-C}, consisting of a fixed-ratio mix of transactions (inserts, updates, selects) for a specific database schema. The only difference was varying the scale factor, which controls for the number of warehouses modeled in the schema. The resulting performance distributions are given in Figure~\ref{fig:h2_intro}.
\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{images/h2_motivation.eps}
	\caption{Performance distributions of the database system \htwo run the \textsf{TPC-C} benchmark at different scale factors.}
	\label{fig:h2_intro}
\end{figure}
While one might first expect that a more complex workload results in lower throughput, this is indeed the case, but does not hold for all configurations. The median throughput decreases for the larger scale factor, yet the shape and spread of the distribution are entirely different. Most notably, the maximum throughput for the greater scale factor is higher than for the smaller scale factor, indicating that some configurations indeed do not follow the general trend. This illustrates that the effect of varying the workload for some configurations can not be captured by a linear transformation (constant shift or scaling).


Some aspects of this \emph{input sensitivity} have been observed and documented before in the literature~\cite{liao_2020_using_emse,alves_sampling_2020,jamishidi_transfer_2017} and raise questions, such as: Which options are input sensitive? What are the driving factors for input sensitivity? Can we estimate which options are input-sensitive? We set out to answer these questions in this paper.

	
\subsection{Workloads and Performance Prediction} ~\label{sec:strategies}
To some aspects of the said questions, different approaches have been proposed to tackle the problem of input sensitivity.

\paragraph{Workload-aware Performance Modeling}\label{sec:workload-aware}
Extending on workload characterization, a strategy that embraces workload diversity is to incorporate workload characteristics into the problem space of a performance prediction model. Here, performance is modeled as a function of both the configuration options exhibited by the software system as well as the workload characteristics, formally $\Pi: C \times W \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.
The combined problem space enables learning performance models that generalize to workloads that exhibit characteristics denoted by $W$ since we can screen for performance-relevant combinations of options and workload characteristics. Although this strategy is highly application-specific, it has been successfully applied to different domains, such as program verification~\cite{koc_satune_2021}. However, its main disadvantages are twofold: The combined problem space (configuration and workload dimension) requires substantially more observations to screen for identifying performance-relevant options, characteristics, and combinations thereof. In addition, previous work  found that that only few configuration options are input sensitive~\cite{jamishidi_transfer_2017} when varying the workload. That is, the problem of identifying meaningful, but sparse predictors is exacerbated since one must not only identify performance-relevant configuration options, but also input sensitive ones.

\paragraph{Transfer Learning for Performance Models}\label{sec:transfer}
Another strategy that builds on the fact that, across different workloads, only few configuration options are in fact input sensitive~\cite{jamishidi_transfer_2017}. Here one first trains a model on a standard workload and, subsequently, adapts it to different workloads. Contrary to a generalizable workload-aware model, transfer learning strategies focus on approximating a transfer function that, without characterizing the workload, encodes the information of which configuration options are sensitive to differences between a source and target pair of workloads. Training a workload-specific model and adapting it on occasion provides an effective means to reuse performance models, which is not limited to workloads~\cite{jamshidi_learning_2018}, but has successfully been applied to different hardware setups~\cite{ding_bayesian_2020,valov_transferring_performance_2017} and across versions~\cite{martin_transfer_2021}. The main shortcoming of transfer learning approaches is that they do not generalize to arbitrary workloads, since a transfer function is tailored to a specific target workload. Here, one trades off generalizability and measurement cost as learning a transfer function requires substantially fewer training samples.\\

While both directions are effective means to handle input sensitivity, to the best of our knowledge, there is no systematic assessment of the factors that drive the interaction between configuration options and workloads with regard to performance. Understanding scenarios that are associated with or even cause incongruent performance influences across workloads can help practitioners to employ established analysis techniques more effectively and can motivate researchers to devise analysis techniques dedicated to such scenarios.

\section{Study Design}~\label{sec:study}
In what follows, we describe the general experiment setup and study design as well as research questions. We make all performance measurement data, configurations, workloads, and learned performance models available on the paper's companion Web site.

\subsection{Research Questions}
Our first two research questions shed light on the input sensitivity of the performance behavior of the studied software systems. We first take a look at systems as a whole~(\RQref{1}) with regard to a large set of configurations and, subsequently, consider individual configuration options~(\RQref{2}). Extending on the results of \RQref{2}, we explore possible driving factors and indicators for workload-specific performance variation~(\RQref{3}).

\paragraph{Performance Variation Across Workloads}
It is well known that performance variation can arise from differences in the workload~\cite{benchmarking_book}. In a practical setting, the question arises whether, and if so, to what extent an existing workload-specific performance model is representative of the performance behavior of other workloads. 
That is, can a model estimating performance of different configurations be reused for the same software system but run with a different workload? Depending on the degree of similarity of the performance behavior across workloads, we obtain a clearer picture of the prevalence of input sensitivity and to what extent the strategies outlined in  Section~\ref{sec:strategies} might be applicable.
To this end, we formulate the following research question: 

\RQ{1}{To what extent does \textit{performance behavior} vary across workloads?}

\paragraph{Option Influence Across Workloads}
At large, performance behavior is the resulting effect arising from multiple configuration optionsâ€™ and combinationsâ€™ respective influences. To understand which configuration options are driving performance variation, in general, and which are input sensitive, in particular, we formulate the following research question:

\RQ{2}{To what extent do \textit{influences of individual configuration options} depend on the workload?}

\paragraph{Causes of Input Sensitivity}
The first two research questions describe the performance behavior of our subject systems: Based on the results of related work, we expect configuration options to be, at least, to some extent input sensitive. To contextualize our findings, we switch our perspective to the code level. The goal is to understand the relationship between input sensitivity (i.e., variation in the performance influence of configuration options) and the execution of the subject system under varying workloads. We hypothesize that executions under different workloads also exhibit variation with respect to what code sections are executed and how this code is used. Using code coverage analysis---an easy to understand and widely employed techniqu---we are interested in how far one could infer or explain performance influence variation just based on code. 

\RQ{3}{Does the variation in configuration options' performance influence across workloads correlate with differences in the respective execution footprint?}

\subsection{Experiment Setup}\label{sec:setup}
\paragraph{Subject Systems}
For our study, we select six configurable software systems implemented in Java. We decided to use Java for mainly two reasons: (1) practically, because we can forgo code modifications for instrumentation by using off-line instrumentation (cf.~Section~\ref{sec:profiling}) for code coverage measurement, and (2) strategically, because Java is one of the most widely used programming languages. We discuss this decision in more detail in Section~\ref{sec:external_validity}. 
All subject systems operate by processing a domain-specific input fed to them
%{\color{purple}\todo{Kann weg, evtl etwas allgemeiner halten}\jumper is a re-implementation of the LAME audio codec for MP3 in Java. \kanzi is a command-line file compression tool. \dconvert is a Java utility to scale images for use in Android apps into different formats and different resolutions. \batik is a Java utility to rasterize vector graphics. \jadx is a decompiler and deobfuscator for Android applications.} The full list of our subject systems and characteristics is presented in Table~\ref{tab:subject_systems}. 
For all software systems, we have measured more than one performance metric (response time and peak amount of memory held by a process), except for \htwo, where we measured throughput only. We focus on response time and throughput to keep our analysis and results comparable.

	\caption{Subject System Characteristics}
	\input{tables/subject_systems.tex}
	\label{tab:subject_systems}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Workload Selection}
We aim at covering a variety of workload characteristics to make use of different functionality of a subject system. For the selection of workloads, we considered general characteristics (e.g., workload size to probe for scaling and utilization factors) and domains-specific characteristics that reflect the specific application domain (e.g., different valid input file types). {\color{green!52!black}As relevant workload characteristics are not always explicitly known, we cannot guarantee that our selection covers all functionality.}
Due to space limitations, we provide here only an overview in Table~\ref{tab:workloads}. The workloads along with a more extensive description is available at the companion Web site. 

%{\color{purple}\todo{move to Tabelle}For \jumper, we selected WAVE audio files that, among others, vary in the sampling rate, number of channels, and file size. For \kanzi, we selected dedicated compression benchmark corpora (sets of files of different types) into our selection and further included files of different types at different scales, among others, a binary of the linux kernel and CSV data. For \dconvert, we selected files that reflect the applicationâ€™s documented input formats (JPEG, PNG, PSD, and SVG) and vary in file size. For \batik, we selected a range of SVG file varying in size. For \jadx, we selected a number popular of Android applications (APK packages) ranging from social media to games and utility applications. For \htwo, we used a selection of application-level benchmarks from \textsc{OLTPBench}~\cite{difallah_oltp_2013}, a load generator for databases that allows for using a variety of performance testing benchmarks, such as \texttt{TPC-C}.}

		\bottomrule
	\end{tabular}
\label{tab:workloads}
\end{table}

\paragraph{Configuration Sampling}\label{sec:sampling}
All subject systems (except \htwo) exhibit both categorical (binary) and numerical configuration options. 
For each subject system, we sampled a set of configurations. As exhaustive coverage of the configuration space is infeasible due to combinatorial explosion~\cite{henardCombining2015}, for binary configuration options, we combine several coverage-based sampling strategies and uniform random sampling into an \emph{ensemble} approach: 
To study the influence of single configuration options, we employ option-wise and negative option-wise sampling~\cite{siegmundPerformanceinfluenceModelsHighly2015}, where each option is enabled once (i.e., in, at least, one configuration), or all except one, respectively. In addition, we used pairwise sampling to study the influences of two-way interactions between configuration options. Interactions of higher degree can be found accordingly, which, however, is computationally prohibitively expensive~\cite{henardCombining2015}. Instead, we augment our sample set with a random sample that is, at least, twice the size of the coverage-based sample. To achieve a uniform random sample, we used \emph{distance-based sampling}~\cite{kaltenecker_distance-based_2019}. Numeric configuration options have been varied across, at least, two levels to account for their effect. All variability models and sample sets can be found on the companion Web site.
	
\paragraph{Coverage Profiling}\label{sec:profiling}
To measure code coverage, we use the on-the-fly profiler \textsc{JaCoCo}. Unlike profilers that use source code instrumentation, on-the-fly instrumentation does not alter the executable binary. From a practical perspective, on-the-fly instrumentation is more flexible and easier to accommodate. Nonetheless, either choice introduces some performance overhead. To avoid this overhead for our performance measurements, we conducted our coverage analysis in a separate run, for which no performance data was collected. 	
	
\paragraph{Hardware Setup}
All experiments were conducted on three different compute clusters, with each subject system was exclusively run on a single cluster. All machines in a compute cluster had the identical hardware setup: either with Intel~Core~i5-8259U CPUs at 2.3~GHz (\jumper and \kanzi),  Intel~Core~i7-8559U CPUs at 2.7~GHz (\dconvert, \batik, and \jadx) and 32~GB of RAM, respectively, or Intel~Xeon~E5-2630~v4 CPUs at 2.2~GHz with 256~GB of RAM (\htwo). All clusters ran a headless Debian 10 installation, the first two with kernel version \mbox{\texttt{4.19.0-14}}, the latter with version \mbox{\texttt{4.19.0-17}}. 
To minimize measurement noise, no additional user processes were running in the background, and no other than necessary packages were installed.	For all data points, we report the median across five repetitions (except for \htwo), which has shown to be a good trade-off between variance and measurement effort. For \htwo, we omitted the repetitions as, in a pre-study, running on the identical cluster setup, we found that across all benchmarks the coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by the arithmetic mean) of the throughput was consistently below~5\,\%.

\section{Study Results}~\label{sec:results}
~
\subsection{Comparing Performance Distributions ($RQ_1$)}\label{sec:rq1}
\subsubsection{Operationalization}
We answer \RQref{1} by pairwisely comparing the performance distributions from different workloads (cf. the comparison in Figure~\ref{fig:h2_intro}) and by determining whether any two distributions are similar or, if not, can be transformed into each other. For the latter case, we are specifically interested in what type of transformation is necessary as this determines \textit{how} complex a workload interacts with configuration options. Specifically, we categorize each pair of workloads with respect to the following aspects: 

\begin{compactenum}
	\item \textbf{Similarity}: To test whether varying the workload has any effect at all, we employ statistical tests. Since performance distributions are often multi-modal or long-tailed~\cite{curtsinger_stabilizer_2013,maricq2018taming}, they fail to meet the requirements for parametric methods. 
	Thus, we resort to a non-parametric approach: We use the Wilcoxon signed-rank test~\cite{lovric_international_2010} to assess whether varying the workload affects configuration performance. If we can reject the null hypothesis $H_0$ at significance level $\alpha~=~0.95$, we consider the distributions dissimilar. In addition, to account for account for overpowering due high and different sample sizes (cf.~Table~\ref{tab:subject_systems}), we report effect sizes to asses whether the effect attributed to varying the workload is negligible or not. We use Cliff's $\delta$ measure~\cite{Cliff1993DominanceSO} to identify non-negliglible differences ($\vert \delta \vert > 0.147$) following the guidelines for interpretation from \citeauthor{romano2006exploring}.~\cite{romano2006exploring}.
	
	\item \textbf{Linear Correlation}: To test whether both performance distributions are shifted by a constant value or scaled by a constant factor, we compute for each pair of distributions Pearson's correlation coefficient $r$. To discard the sign of relationship, we use the absolute value and consider $\vert r\vert >0.6$ indicates a strong linear relationship. 
	
	\item \textbf{Monotone Correlation}: Finally, we test whether there exists a monotonous relationship between the two performance distributions. We use Kendall's rank correlation coefficient $\tau$~\cite{kendall1938new} and consider $\vert\tau\vert > 0.6$ a strong monotonous relationship.
\end{compactenum}

{\color{black} Based on these three tests and metrics, we composed four categories that each pair of performance distributions can be categorized into. If we cannot reject $H_0$, we consider them identical and as similar distributions (\textsf{\colorbox{cs-color}{SD}}). If both distributions exhibit a strong linear relationship, we classify them as linearly transformable (\textsf{\colorbox{lt-color}{LT}}). If we observe a strong monotonous, but not a linear relationship, we classify such pairs as exclusively monotonously transformable into a separate category (\textsf{\colorbox{xmt-color}{XMT}}). Last, if the comparison yields no monotonous relationship, we can only transform them using non-monotonous methods (\textsf{\colorbox{nmt-color}{NMT}}). We summarize the category criteria as well as the category counts in Table~\ref{tab:categorization}.

\subsubsection{Results}
We summarize the results of our classification in Table~\ref{tab:categorization_counts}. For all of the six software systems, varying the workloads has an effect on the performance distribution. All software systems, at least, in part, exhibit performance distributions that can be transformed into one another using an linear (also called \textit{affine}) transformation, such shifting by a constant value or scaling by a constant factor. In particular, for \jumper and \jadx, we did  observe only such behavior. This finding corresponds to experimental insights~\citeauthor{jamishidi_transfer_2017}, who encoded differences between performance distributions using linear functions. For four software systems, we obtained a more diverse picture. For \kanzi and \batik, a few performance distributions require transformations that are non-linear, but still monotonous. For \dconvert and \htwo, the majority of performance distribution pairs cannot be described by a monotonous relationship. In total, four out of the six software systems exhibit \emph{non-monotonous} relationships across, at least, one workload.

\subsection{Input Sensitivity of Options ($RQ_2$)}\label{sec:rq2}

\subsubsection{Operationalization}
To address \RQref{2}, we need to determine the configuration optionsâ€™ influence on performance and assess the variation thereof across workloads. 

\paragraph*{Explanatory Model}
We achieve this by learning models resembling the performance prediction models from Section~\ref{sec:perfmodels}, yet with a slightly twisted purpose: Instead of predicting unseen configurationsâ€™ performance, we intend to attribute performance variation to different configuration options. Here, we deliberately consider the \textit{entire} sample set for training. 
To reason about performance influences, we require the explanatory model to be interpretable. We reenact the class of linear models for performance learning~\cite{dorn2020,siegmundPerformanceinfluenceModelsHighly2015,perLasso} and construct a model using multiple linear regression with each configuration as a predictor or independent variable. We limit the set of independent variables to individual options rather than to include higher-order interactions to be consistent with the feature location used for \RQref{3} where we determine option-specific, yet not interaction-specific code segments.

\paragraph*{Standardization}
To facilitate the comparison of regression coefficients across workloads, we follow the practice in machine learning and standardize our dependent variable by subtracting the populationâ€™s mean performance and divide the result by the respective standard deviation. Henceforth, we will refer to these standardized regression coefficients as \textit{relative performance influences}. A beneficial side effect of this standardization step is that the observed variation of regression coefficients for each configuration option cannot be attributed to shifting or scaling effects (affine transformation, class \colorbox{lt-color}{\textsf{LT}} in Table~\ref{tab:categorization}) as we applied such transformation by standardizing the performance values.. Thus, with this approach we can directly target the non-linear or explicitly non-monotonous effect that workloads exercise on performance.

\paragraph*{Handling Multicollinearity}A problem faced when learning linear models from training samples, where some features are correlated is multicollinearity~\cite{Daoud_2017}. This can, for instance, arise from groups of mutually exclusive configuration options and result in distorted regression coefficients although the model's prediction accuracy remains unaffected. To mitigate this problem and, in particular, to ensure that the obtained performance influences remain interpretable, we drop several configuration options from the sample set, which has shown to be an effective practice~\cite{dorn2020}. For the training step, we exclude all mandatory configuration options since these by definition cannot contribute to performance variation. In addition, for each group of mutually exclusive configuration options, we discard one randomly selected group member. \\

From the comparison of the relative performance influences, we can answer \RQref{2} in detail and assess how many configurations are sensitive to varying the workload, what characteristic traits describe the performance influences, and whether we can identify patterns.
\subsubsection{Results}
We illustrate the results of training the explanatory performance models for each subject system in Figure~\ref{fig:results_influence}. Each row shows the distribution of the relative performance influence of a configuration option across the set of tested workloads. For this visualization, we made some tweaks to highlight a few characteristics: First, we show each regression coefficient as an individual black diamond. Second,  to visualize the range of obtained coefficients, the minimum and maximum ones are connected via a black line. Third, the positive and negative coefficients with their respective greatest absolute value determine the color-coded bars to highlight if a coefficient flips its sign by varying the workload. Last, we decided to use this visualization over box plots (or related ones, such as violin plots) since these would hide this level of detail and are more useful for larger data sets.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/out.png}
	\caption{Relative performance influences (\textit{standardized regression coefficients}) for all configuration options across all workloads. Each black bar depicts a workload-specific performance influence. For each configuration option, we highlight the range of observed influences.}
	\label{fig:results_influence}
\end{figure}

We can describe the distribution of coefficients by their characteristics including their \textit{range of spread} (distance between minimum and maximum), their \textit{clustering}, and whether they contribute \textit{consistently positive} or \textit{negative} influences. With regard to Table 2, we see that  \jadx exhibits fairly consistent distributions, where only the influential optionsâ€™ influences show a substantial range. While \jumper, scored similarly for \RQref{1}, we can observe the first configuration options behaving inconsistently: For options \textsf{JointStereo}, \textsf{MidStereo}, and \textsf{SwapBytes} the coefficient can switch signs, or in the case of \textsf{Mono} can distinctly vary in magnitude. For \batik, we observe for the majority of configuration options a wide range and a sign-flip for the option \textsf{pdf}. While we see a wide range and sign-flipping for \dconvert as well, it also  shows another distinct case: The influence of options \textsf{round}, \textsf{png}, and \textsf{floor} is influential only under certain workloads and can also flip sign (except for \textsf{png}). For the last two systems, \kanzi and \htwo which exhibit the greatest share of non-monotonous differences between performance distributions, we find all of the above described characteristics: sign-flipping for options \textsf{Huffmann}, \textsf{RLT} (both \kanzi), and \textsf{MVSTORE} (\htwo); influential option only under some workloads: \textsf{BWT} (\kanzi), \textsf{DEFRAG\_ALWAYS} and \textsf{COMPRESS} (both \htwo); or a wide range: \textsf{TPAQX} (\kanzi) and \textsf{MVSTORE} (\htwo).

\begin{comment}
We address this research question by learning and comparing performance models from the measurements of our experiments~\cite{dorn2020,siegmundPerformanceinfluenceModelsHighly2015,haDeepPerf2019,perfAL,guoVariabilityawarePerformancePrediction2013,sarkarCostEfficientSamplingPerformance,guo_2018_data,fourier_learning_2015,perLasso}. As a performance model effectively estimates the influence of individual configuration options on performance, we construct models not to predict unseen configurations but simply to explain differences observed in the performance distributions. So, for the construction of our performance models, we deliberately learn performance models using the entire sample set. 
To correct for multicollinearity~\cite{Daoud_2017} and to ensure that the obtained performance influences are interpretable, we drop several configuration options from the sample set, which has shown to be an effective practice~\cite{dorn2020}. For the training step, we exclude all mandatory configuration options since these by definition cannot contribute to performance variation. In addition, for each group of mutually exclusive configuration options, we discard one randomly selected group member.

Many different machine learning techniques have been used to obtain performance models, among others, based on linear regression~\cite{perLasso,siegmundPerformanceinfluenceModelsHighly2015,dorn2020}. To answer \RQref{2}, we learn a prediction model using multiple linear regression (least-squares method). We limit the set of independent variables to individual options rather than higher-order interactions to be consistent with the feature location used for \RQref{3} where we determine option-specific, but not interaction-specific code segments.

From the comparison of the performance model coefficients, we can answer \RQref{2} in detail and assess (1) how many configuration options, on average, change their influence, and (2) how many configuration options, in total, change their influence. For any pair of workload-specific performance models, we divide the performance model coefficients by the respective mean performance to make the model influences comparable across workloads. Henceforth, we will refer to these coefficients as \textit{relative performance influences.} Since these relative performance influences have been divided by the population mean, we report these without any unit.

\section{Exploring Categories of Sensitivity}\label{sec:categories}
\subsection{Code Coverage and Performance ($RQ_3$)}\label{sec:rq3}
So far, we have only studied how different workloads can shape the overall performance and how they can affect the performance influence of configuration options. In addition, we want to know how the observed variation emerges from  varying the workload. To understand workload effects at a finer granularity, we travel back to the level of code and extend our perspective on the problem with statement coverage data. 

\paragraph*{Operationalization}
To approach this research question, we relate two types of variation for pairs of workloads. On the one hand, we compare the relative performance influences of an option. That is, we compute the absolute difference between the relative performance influences. On the other hand, we determine how much option-specific code (code segments that implement or regulate a functionality related to the configuration option) is covered under both workloads. That is, we ask how similar both workloads cover option-specific code. If the same part of option-specific code is executed under both workloads but we observe variation in the performance influence, this suggests that both workloads utilize the same code differently.



For each option and pair of workloads, in the following, we relate the difference in performance influence (performance influence variation) with the Jaccard similarity for option code (code coverage variation) for all pairs of workloads.

\subsubsection{Feature Location}
To reason about option-specific code, we require a mapping of configuration options to code. First, we obtain a baseline of \textit{all} option code within the scope of our entire workload selection. For each workload $w \in W$, we compute the set of code lines that depend on option $o \in O$. Let $C_{o}$ be the set of configurations with option $o$ selected, and $C_{\neg o}$ with option $o$ deselected. To obtain $S_{w, o}$, we follow a strategy similar to \textit{spectrum-based feature location}~\cite{michelon_spectrum_2021} and subtract the set of the code lines covered under $C_{\neg o}$ from those of $C_{o}$:

\begin{equation}%\todo{example from Figure~\ref{fig:intro}}
	S_{w, o} = \bigcup_{p \in C_{o}} S_{w}(p) ~ \setminus ~ \bigcup_{q \in C_{\neg o}} S_{w}(q)
\end{equation}

While $S_{w, o}$ yields an approximation of option-dependent code for a single workload, we then aggregate the approximations for each workload $w\in W$ to obtain the set of lines that depend on a configuration option $o$ and are executed in, at least, one workload,~$S_{o}$: 

\begin{equation}
	S_{o} = \bigcup_{w \in W} S_{w, o}
\end{equation}

While this aggregated set is not a ground truth, it enables us to reason about differences in option-dependent code within the scope of our selected workloads. That is, the expressiveness of this baseline depends on the diversity of the workloads in question. We discuss this limitation in Section~\ref{sec:construct_validity}. From the ratio of option-specific code per workload to option-specific code across workloads, $\mid S_{w_1, o}\mid/~{\mid S_{w_2, o}\mid}$, we can estimate the coverage of option-dependent code. By comparing the sets $S_{w_1, o}$ and $S_{w_2, o}$ for any two workloads $w_1$ and $w_2$, we can estimate similarity between the option-code coverage via the Jaccard set similarity index. We review further techniques for feature location in Section~\ref{sec:related}.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec:discussion}

\subsection{Threats to Validity}
\subsubsection{Internal Validity}\label{sec:internal_validity}
Threats to \emph{internal validity} include measurement noise which may distort our classification into categories (Section~\ref{sec:rq1}) and model construction (Section~\ref{sec:rq2}). We mitigate this threat by repeating each experiment five times and reporting the median as a robust measure. For \htwo, we confirmed a negligible measurement variation in a separate pre-study.
Another potential threat is that the coverage analysis with \mbox{\textsc{JaCoCo}} entails a noticeable instrumentation overhead, which may distort performance observations. We mitigate this threat by separating the experiment runs for coverage assessment and performance measurement. In the case of \htwo, the load generator of the \textsc{OLTPBench} framework~\cite{difallah_oltp_2013} ran on the same machine as the database since we were testing an embedded scenario but thus introduced only negligible variation and overhead.

\subsubsection{External Validity}\label{sec:external_validity}
The selection of subject systems all written in Java poses a threat to \emph{external validity}. While our motivation for this selection is primarily practical (cf. Section~\ref{sec:setup}), we mitigate this threat by selecting subject systems from a variety of application domains (cf.~Table~\ref{tab:subject_systems}). Nonetheless, one cannot necessarily conclude that our results hold for other domains and programming languages. 

\subsubsection{Construct Validity}\label{sec:construct_validity}
Regarding \emph{construct validity}, the profiler \textsc{JaCoCo} instruments Java byte code instructions rather than statements, which leads to some minor imprecision when mapping covered instructions back to the original statements. Transitively, this also affects the precision of our feature location (cf. Section~\ref{sec:rq3}). This drawback, however, is not limited to this particular profiler but applies to most profilers operating on byte code. 
Superimposition in our feature location technique is sound, but, by design, incomplete, since no set of workloads is guaranteed to cover all feature code. We selected a variety of different workloads as a countermeasure, yet our study is exploratory.

\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related}
\paragraph*{Feature Location}\label{sec:feature_location}
The problem of determining which code implements which functionality in a software system is known as \emph{feature location}~\cite{rubin_feature_2013}. Most feature location approaches either employ static or dynamic program analysis to infer a mapping between features and code. As for static analyses, variables that encode configuration options are tainted and, from tracing dataflow and controlflow, one can infer code sections tainted by such variables~\cite{velez_2020_configcrusher_jase,lillack_2018_lotrack_tse,luo_2019_cova}.
While static analyses can yield precise results, scalability is often limited by the exploration of all possible execution paths. To mitigate this shortcoming, dynamic taint analysis taints variables similarly to the static approaches, but only follows one execution path~\cite{bell_phosphor_2014,velez_comprex_2021,splat_kim_2013}. From few executions of different configurations, one can extract feature-specific code. 
Aside from program analysis, a more tame, but also less precise approach is to use code coverage information, such as execution traces.
The rationale is that by exercising feature code, for instance via enabling configuration options or running corresponding tests, its location can be inferred from code coverage differences. Applications of such an approach have been studied not only for feature location~\cite{wong_integrated_2005,sulir_annotation_2015,michelon_spectrum_2021,perez_framing_2016}, but root in program comprehension~\cite{wilde_early_1996,wilde_reconnaissance_1995,sherwood_reducing_nodate,perez_diagnosis_2014,castro_pangolin_2019} and fault localization~\cite{agrawal_fault_1995,wong_faultloc_2016}. 

\paragraph*{Workload-specific Performance}\label{sec:workload_performance}
In performance and load testing, it is a common practice to select a workload that is reflective of the software system in question~\cite{ceesay2020,papadopoulos2021}. This can be achieved by constructing workloads, among others, from usage patterns~\cite{calzarossa2016}, or by increasing the workload coverage by using a mix of different workloads rather than a single one~\cite{jiang2015survey}.
The benefit of using more than one specific workload for performance models is illustrated by the work of \citeauthor{liao_2020_using_emse}~\cite{liao_2020_using_emse}. For two different versions of a software system, they learn performance models based on disjoint sets of workloads. From the comparison of both performance models, they were able to identify performance shifts as the workload bias was averaged out.

\citeauthor{jamishidi_transfer_2017} observe that performance influences across different environments remain largely congruent and differences only affect small numbers of configuration options. Workload-specific differences can be learned efficiently via transfer learning~\cite{jamishidi_transfer_2017,jamshidi_transfer_gp_2017,ding_bayesian_2020}, where an existing workload-specific performance model is adapted to a new workload by explicitly learning a transfer function. \citeauthor{jamshidi_learning_2018} exploit similarities in performance behavior across workloads to guide the configuration sampling process an efficiently learn transfer functions~\cite{jamshidi_learning_2018}. {\color{purple} For software verification tools, \citeauthor{koc_satune_2021} incorporate program characteristics (e.g., the number of loops) as features orthogonal to configuration options into the problem space for performance modeling.}
